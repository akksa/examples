The price associated with covering a car has rapidly fallen since the new efforts went into effect.
In the United Kingdom, the cost of auto insurance is dropping rapidly following a fraud and claim management company crackdown that has been very effective in shrinking the problem.
According to recent data, the average annual comprehensive coverage quote has plummeted.
The AA, over the past year, there has been a reduction in the size of comprehensive auto insurance quotes by approximately 10 percent. This is the largest decrease that has been recorded by the organization since it began its index in 1994.
The average auto insurance policy saw a drop of 9.8 percent, which has brought considerable relief to drivers.
The data revealed that the average auto insurance policy is now sitting at £594.86 per year, which is notably lower than it was last year in July, when it was £659.53. This considerable decrease followed one of 6 percent that had been experienced the year before that.
Although drivers of all ages have been watching their auto insurance
premiums slide downward over the last year, it is the younger drivers between the ages of 23 and 29 years old who are benefiting the most. Their premiums have dropped by approximately 12.8 percent. For that age group, the average annual premiums are currently £738.93.
At the same time, there was also a decrease in the figure for third party, theft, and fire coverage, which fell by 4.8 percent over the last year, bringing it to £820.58.
The director of AA Insurance, Simon Douglas, stated that “This will be welcome news for hard-pressed motorists facing sharp fuel price increases.” He added that “Insurers were facing a fast-widening gap between premium income and claims costs, largely driven by whiplash injury claims and fraud which saw very sharp premium increases between 2009 and 2011.”
Douglas explained that this gap is now shrinking and this is leading auto insurance premiums to reduce once more, as a result of competition and the improvements that have been made to fraud detection by the industry. Moreover, it was also supported by the tightening of a law that is starting to reduce the number of new false whiplash injury claims.

ANNISTON, Ala. (AP)  U.S. Attorneys officials say a former U.S. Postal Service letter carrier has been convicted of disability fraud.
Prosecutors say 40-year-old Sean Eric Slaton of Anniston was found guilty last week of eight counts of false statements, 24 counts of wire fraud and a count of theft of government property.
Officials say Slaton received payments from the Department of Labor's Office of Workers Compensation in 2002 after he was injured while on duty in a 2001 car accident in Birmingham.
Authorities say Slaton reported false information about his disability to the Postal Service beginning in 2011. Prosecutors say Slaton was also charged with filing false reports about his income, employment and business activities between 2009 and 2012.

* Fraud revenue used for drugs, arms, wages
* Mob boss turned informant; 70 arrests in dawn raids
* Senator also under investigation
By Steve Scherer
ROME, July 26 (Reuters) - A mafia clan in southern Italy staged hundreds of fake car crashes every year to get millions of euros in insurance payouts to buy drugs and weapons, police said on Friday.
The insurance fraud was just one of the charges against 70 people sought for arrest in dawn raids by police on Friday in the Calabrian city of Lamezia Terme, near the ""toe"" of Italy.
""The insurance scam permitted the boss to manage his clan, to buy guns and drugs, and to pay his men,"" Rodolfo Ruperti, head of the police squad that carried out the investigation, told Reuters.
The mob had local insurers, doctors, lawyers and auto body repairers on the payroll to pull off the fraud which earned the gang well over a million euros ($1.3 million) a year, Ruperti said. Police seized assets worth 1.2 million euros.
The defrauded insurer was a local branch of Zurich Insurance Group, which operated independently, under licence from the head office in Switzerland.
""Zurich does not comment on ongoing investigations and legal proceedings,"" the Swiss group said in an email.
The insurance hoax was just one of the crimes the mafia gang is suspected of. Boss Giuseppe Giampa, 32, extorted protection money from local businesses and sold the clan's votes to the highest bidder in a 2010 mayoral vote, police said.
The investigation has a breakthrough when Giampa turned informant, much more unusual in the brutal and closed Calabrian mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, than in Sicily or Naples. Investigators would not say why he chose to give evidence.
In Rome, a Calabrian senator in Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right People of Freedom (PDL) party is being investigated for suspected vote buying as part of the investigation, police said.
Another PDL politician, who is deputy chairman of the local airport management company, has been arrested, along with prison guards suspected of being on the boss's payroll. Finance police arrested several local businessmen, including a fireworks manufacturer suspected of providing explosives to the gang.
Giampa is suspected of ordering about 20 murders in a mob war for control of the city between 2005 and 2011. Among those arrested on Friday were hitmen thought to be behind 11 killings, Ruperti said.
""It was a mafia system that not only stained Lamezia Terme with blood and murder, but it also bled dry the already fragile local economy,"" provincial police chief Guido Marino said. ($1 = 0.7555 euros)   (Editing by Barry Moody and Robin Pomeroy)

"State Farm suing 1-800-ASK-GARY founder Dr. Gary Kompothecras
7:16 PM, Jul 29, 2013   |  
 PDF Document: State Farm Lawsuit
ST. PETERSBURG, Florida -- State Farm Insurance is suing Dr. Gary Kompothecras, the Siesta Key chiropractor who built a massive empire around the 1-800-ASK-GARY hotline.
The suit filed in federal court claims Kompothecras, several of his companies, including The Physicians Group, and one of his cousins were involved in a ""massive fraud scheme"".
State Farm, which declined interview requests from 10 News, claims in the suit that ""ASK GARY is not an independent and legitimate medical and legal referral service"" and it only refers callers ""to Kompothecras' own clinics,"" all in a ""scheme to exhaust their unsuspecting patients' limited No-Fault Benefits"".
State Farm says its paid $19 million since 2005 to the The Physicians Group, controlled by Kompothecras, and the money was used to continue building the ""ASK GARY"" brand.
Physicians Group's response to the lawsuit filed:
""The lawsuit filed by State Farm is a frivolous and malicious suit that has no merit and will be dismissed by the Court. It is evident that this lawsuit was filed as a result of the devastating loss to insurance companies, including State Farm, by the Florida Supreme Court in the recent case Virtual Imaging vs. Geico case, decided on July 3, 2013  which ruled against insurance carriers' failure to pay their insureds and medical providers the reasonable medical costs incurred by the policy holders.
This suit is a desperate act by State Farm, one of the largest and most profitable insurance companies, who owes Physicians Group over $9 million by its failure to pay over 1000 claims for medical costs incurred by its policy holders. 
All the Defendants, including Physicians Group and the 1-800 ASK GARY hotline comply with all Florida and Federal laws. The statements in the lawsuit would be libelous of the Physicians Group and the other Defendants but for it being stated in this salacious lawsuit. None of the defendants have ever been cited as engaging in unlawful conduct by the Florida Bar or any medical board.
Examples of the blatant lies in the suit are that contrary to the claims in the suit, a great number of people who call the 1-800 ASK GARY hotline are not referred to the Physicians Group. Also all attorneys who are part of the Ask Gary network are not advised or required to refer any of their clients to the Physicians Group or any medical providers. This is a condition contained in the attorneys agreement with the Ask Gary network.
State Farm will be exposed to claims for malicious prosecution by pursuing this absurd action to attempt to avoid paying the millions of dollars it owes to the defendants. This is not the first, or the last time an insurance company acts in bad faith exposing it to significant liability.""

"Car insurance drops by record levels as industry cracks down on bogus claims
Average quote plunges by 9.8 per cent in one year
Biggest drop since AA insurance index began in 1994
23-29 year olds enjoy the biggest fall

The cost of car insurance has dipped by record levels, bringing welcome relief to cash-strapped drivers, according to new figures.
The average quote for annual comprehensive car insurance has plunged to £594.86 – a 9.8 per cent drop from the figure of £659.53 in July last year, AA Insurance said.
This marks the biggest drop since the AA insurance index began in 1994.
Falling costs: The average annual comprehensive car insurance quote has dropped by 9.8 per cent in a year, according to a study
The fall is largely thanks to clampdowns on fraud and new restrictions on claims management companies, it said. But despite the fall, premiums remain much higher than they were six years ago.
While all age groups have seen costs call, those aged 23-29 have enjoyed the biggest decreases with their average costs falling 12.8 per cent to £738.93.
 
Honda named most reliable car manufacturer for eighth year in a row while 86% of Bentleys suffered faults last year
All age groups have seen 12-month falls of at least 5.4 per cent, except those aged 70 or above who have had to settle for a 3.9 per cent fall in premiums.
On average, those aged 60-69 have the cheapest annual insurance (£342.73) and those aged 17-22 have the most expensive (£1,210.54).
 
The falls follow an industry crackdown on bogus insurance claims, which add at least £50 to the typical insurance policy according to the Association of British Insurers.
However bogus claims still cost insurance customers over £1billion a year, the association claimed.
Third party, fire and theft insurance has also dipped in the last 12 months, dropping by 4.8 per cent to £820.58, the AA study found.
Comparing July 2013 figures with those of April, the AA showed that comprehensive insurance has fallen 3 per cent and third-party insurance is down 2.2 per cent.
AA Insurance director Simon Douglas said: ‘This will be welcome news for hard-pressed motorists facing sharp fuel price increases.
‘Insurers were facing a fast-widening gap between premium income and claims costs, largely driven by whiplash injury claims and fraud which saw very sharp premium increases between 2009 and 2011.’
He went on: ‘That gap is closing and premiums are falling again thanks to competition, as well as improved fraud detection by the insurance industry and tightening of the law that is beginning to curb the number of spurious new whiplash injury claims.
‘The news that hundreds of rogue 'no-win no-fee' claims firms have been reined in is welcome and in part, falling insurance premiums reflect that.
‘I hope that Britain's shameful reputation as being the 'whiplash claim capital of Europe' will now be put behind us.’

Doctor with Glen Osborne Practice Charged with Insurance Fraud
The Pennsylvania Attorney General’s office says Dr. Stacey Y. Royal submitted more than $2 million in false claims.

A family physician from Ohio is facing felony charges accused of billing more than $2 million in false insurance claims through her Glen Osborne medical practice.
The Pennsylvania Attorney General’s office has filed charges against Dr. Stacey Y. Royal, 48, Marysville, Ohio, including six felony counts of theft by deception and three felony counts of insurance fraud.
According to a criminal complaint, Royal established the Royal Treatment Urgent Care, Inc. at 1106 Ohio River Boulevard, Suite 602, in June 2009 while she was also under criminal investigation in Ohio for submitting false claims. 
An investigator with the insurance fraud section of the AG's office reports that Royal duplicated and grossly inflated claims billed to Highmark and Michigan Blue Cross. 
Between July 2009 and March 2010, she billed more than $1.65 million in false claims for her husband, Christopher Davis, and received $458,300 in payments, the complaint states.  Highmark policy prohibits reimbursements for professional services to immediate relatives or household members. 
The complaint said Royal also billed Highmark $54,477 in claims from July 2009 to September 2009 for services she provided to a high school friend. Royal received $4,208 in payments, although the complaint says she never rendered many of the services. 
A Highmark official, in reviewing Royal's claims, discovered 12 line items totaling more than $629,000 in dispensed medications that should have cost less than $1,000 for a one-month supply of the drugs. 
The drugs included antibiotics, codeine syrup and allergy medications.
The complaint states that Royal was able to get more money back and avoid regular billing standards by using a code intended only to be used when medication is administered during a procedure. 
A criminal investigation into her practices began in April 2010 after the Ohio Department of Insurance contacted the insurance fraud division of the AG’s office regarding similar charges in Ohio.  
Royal was indicted in Ohio on Nov. 4, 2009 for felony theft, telemarketing fraud, insurance fraud and engaging in the pattern of corrupt activity.  She pleaded guilty, was sentenced to five years probation and ordered to pay $234,144 in restitution and a $10,000 fine.
Davis, was the office manager at the medical facility, and was also indicted on aiding and abetting, and engaging in the pattern of corrupt activity. Davis was found guilty on all charges, sentenced to six months in jail and ordered to pay $133,000 in restitution.
The Ohio indictment showed between 2004 and 2009, Royal billed for 180 treatments and office visits for Davis, and also billed an insurer for performing a heart surgery she did not do, the complaint said. 
Royal remains in Allegheny County Jail unable to post $25,000 bond. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for July 30 at Leetsdale District Court.

Frayba and William Tipton appear in court in 2009 to face charges of insurance fraud and arson.  Press file photo
slideshow
STOCKTON — Six witnesses testified for the prosecution as the trial of a Tracy husband and wife charged with insurance fraud and embezzlement began Friday, July 19, in San Joaquin County Superior Court.
William Tipton and Frayba Tipton are charged with making a fraudulent claim for insurance payment, perjury, insurance fraud and embezzlement.
Insurance fraud investigators reported that William Tipton told bank officials that he stopped making loan payments for a 2004 Mustang Cobra because it was destroyed when his house at 27771 S. Fagan Road caught fire on July 5, 2008.
During the trial, Detective Scott Edelen, of the State of California Department of Insurance Fraud Division, told Prosecutor J.C. Weydert that investigators recovered the undamaged 2004 Mustang
during a warranted search at the Tiptons’ house on June 14, 2012.
He said they also seized two other vehicles, a 2006 Ford F250 pickup and a 2008 Ford Mustang Shelby Cobra, also for alleged payment default.
During the search, Edelen said investigators saw the pickup in the driveway and found the two Mustangs in the garage. All three were on his seizure list.
Maria Ramirez, a former financial protection specialist for Tracy Federal Credit Union, now Valley First Credit Union, testified that William Tipton spoke to her at the bank shortly after the fire. She said he wanted to discuss his lack of loan payments on the 2004 Mustang, telling her and another employee, Millie Gonzalez, that the car was damaged in the fire.
During the bank’s investigation, Ramirez said investigators saw a burned vehicle frame inside the Tiptons’ garage and believed it was the 2004 Mustang. She said they found out later that it was the body of an SUV.
Under cross examination by defense attorney Russell Humphrey, Ramirez said William Tipton had paid half the money he owed on the 2004 Mustang before he defaulted on the loan.
The owner of Anthony’s Auto Body and Paint on Chrisman Road, Anthony Kronenderger, testified that the 2004 Mustang was in his business garage at the time of the fire. He said the car had a work authorization order to repair a door lock issued on July 2, 2008, and his paperwork showed it was picked up July 11, 2008.
Tracy Fire Department Engineer Dan Peeler, an arson investigator for the department, confirmed on the stand that the vehicle destroyed in the fire was not the 2004 Mustang but an SUV.
Peeler told Weydert he was at the Tiptons’ house to take samples to determine if any liquids or other substances might have caused the fire. Neither lawyer asked him about the findings of his investigation.
Weydert told Judge Lauren Thomasson that he anticipated calling three more prosecution witnesses, and Humphrey said he planned to call Frayba Tipton as the first witness for the defense.
The trial is scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. Tuesday, July 30, in Department 14 in Stockton superior court.

"Feds Get Tough On Medicare Fraud: Moratorium Bans New Healthcare Agencies In Miami, Chicago, And Houston
By Cindy del Rosario | Jul 28, 2013 04:29 PM EDT
TEXT SIZE 
  
Invoking new authority granted by the Affordable Care Act, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)  are imposing six month moratoriums on new agencies and providers from receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments, in an effort to combat fraud in three cities.
""The goal of the temporary moratoria is to fight fraud and safeguard taxpayer dollars, while ensuring patient access to care,"" according to a CMS statement .
The moratorium will begin on Tuesday, July 30 and will affect new home health agencies in eight counties in Miami and Chicago, as well as ambulance service providers in eight counties in Houston. Providers will be unable to receive reimbursements from Medicare, state-run Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program, all of which are tax-funded programs. Existing providers will not be affected by the moratorium.
The three banned metropolitans were targeted for three key reasons — disproportionate number of providers and suppliers compared to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, a rapid growth in agency applications, and extremely high utilization of services. ""All three areas ranked near the top across the nation on all of these fraud risk factors,"" according to the Federal Register .
In 2012, 662 home health agencies were operating in Miami-Dade county, making its home healthcare agency to Medicare beneficiary ratio 1,960 percent greater than other counties. South Florida is notorious for being a hot-bed for Medicare fraud, in part because of several high-profile cases. In February, owners and operators of 2 Miami home health agencies were found guilty  of participating in $48 million Medicare fraud scheme.
In Chicago's Cook County, the number of home health providers increased from 301 in 2008 to 509 in 2012, a 169 percent increase. The ratio of beneficiaries to ambulance suppliers in Harris County, Texas, is several hundred times greater than other counties.
CMS, the administrative body overseeing these programs, was given the authority to impose moratoriums on certain sectors and regions as part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. It is hoped that the moratorium will help stem the estimated $60 billion in Medicare fraud occurring annually throughout the country.
Chicago, Miami, and Houston are three of nine Medicare Fraud Strike Force  regions — cities subject to increased law enforcement to combat Medicare Fraud. Each of the three cities has ""experienced intense, sustained criminal prosecution activity with respect to the provider and supplier types subject to these moratoria,"" according to the Federal Review.
Some worry that this moratorium would harm legitimate providers and therefore hamper area patients' access to care. Marilyn Tavenner, chief administrator of CMS, said in a statement that this would not happen, but offered no elaboration.
In the past, federal health officials tried to combat fraud by slowing the application process for new providers, but received a lot of complaints. Also, CMS had revoked the IDs of suspicious agencies, but such a fix is only temporary as people went on to apply for money under another name.
According to the statement , CMS revoked over 14,000 supplier's ability to collect Medicare reimbursements since March 2011, for reasons including ""felony convictions, not being in operation at the address CMS had on file, or otherwise not being in compliance with CMS rules.""

A jury had just cleared her of the most serious of those charges: alleged fraud in connection  with a $396,880 town project to replace the Windsor Road culvert in  2007.
The project was awarded to her husband, Marshall Swan, and  Carole Swan signed the warrants to pay for it while she was in office.
Swan,  55, also was cleared of two counts of committing fraud by falsifying  documents she filed for federal workers' compensation.
She was  convicted of two counts of workers' compensation fraud and five counts  of falsifying income tax returns, by failing to declare about $650,000  in income from Marshall Swan Construction, the earth-moving company  owned by her and her husband, and failing to pay $140,000 due in income  and self-employment taxes.
She, a sister and her attorneys were packing up briefcases full of paperwork used throughout the case.
Chief  Judge John A. Woodcock Jr. opted against requiring Swan to secure her  bail, which the prosecutor requested, so she was free.
Woodcock told Swan she would be sentenced at a later date.
Each  of the income tax fraud charges carries a maximum sentence of three  years and a $250,000 fine. Each of the workers' compensation fraud  charges carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, a $250,000  fine and restitution.
Her attorney, Leonard Sharon, told the judge she planned to live with her sister.
Swan  testified she moved out of her family home July 7, the night before her  trial started, to escape what she claimed was years of domestic abuse  at the hands of her husband, Marshall Swan.
Sharon said early  Saturday morning that Swan had told him eight months ago about being  abused, but she refused to leave her family home until her younger son,  John, 18, graduated from high school, which he did last month.
Sharon  said he warned her the longer she waited, the more the prosecutor could  use it against her. The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Donald  Clark, told the jury that Swan had opportunities to leave over the years  and an independent income, but did not.
Clark said he had no comment on the verdict, as is usual.
As  the initial guilty verdicts on the income tax counts were announced,  Sharon put his arm briefly across Swan's shoulders. Then there was a  visible start at the defense table when the first ""not guilty"" verdict  was announced.
The jury had deliberated for nine hours.
""We  couldn't have had a fairer trial,"" Sharon said shortly after the jury  gave its verdict. ""We knew the income tax case was difficult. We're very  happy we won the culvert case. At least we've stopped the vendetta from  the town, the disgruntled citizens.""
Sharon said during his  closing arguments that there was a vendetta in the town to get Carole  Swan. Sharon Morang, who served as a Chelsea selectman from June 2007 to  July 2010, denied there was a vendetta.
She said she is a member  of Chelsea, Maine-Citizens Concerned for Our Town, founded in 2010 and  aimed at gathering public information about town business and publishing  it on Facebook.
""It was done to make sure everything in town was  transparent. It was a very gray area. We wanted to get all the  information out to the citizens,"" Morang said.

By Alexis Stevens
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
The owner of a Cobb County speech therapy company is accused of billing Medicaid for more than $500,000 worth of faulty claims.
A Cobb County grand jury indicted Timothy Robinson on four counts of Medicaid fraud and four counts of identity fraud, state Attorney General Sam Olens said Monday.
Robinson was the owner and operator of Robinson Rehabilitation Services Inc., which offered speech therapy services in Cobb County, Olens said. Robinson employed four speech therapists and was authorized to submit billing on their behalf to Georgia Medicaid.
During 2009 and 2010, all four speech therapists resigned from Robinson’s company, but Robinson allegedly continued billing for services using the four providers’ identification.
“In total, Robinson fraudulently received $549,326.05 in Medicaid payments to which he was not entitled,” according to a press release from the Attorney General’s Office.
Medicaid fraud is punishable by one to 10 years in prison and a fine of $10,000, Olens said. Identity fraud is punishable by one to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $100,000.
A trial date was not announced.

"Second indictment issued against Mont Vernon woman in arson case
By NANCY BEAN FOSTER
Union Leader Correspondent
CARR 
NASHUA — A second indictment has been handed down against Colleen Carr, a Mont Vernon woman who allegedly conspired to burn down a building she owns on the Milford Oval in order to collect the insurance money.
Carr, 50, of 19 Mobile Coach Lane in Mont Vernon, was arrested on Jan. 17 by Milford police and charged with one count of conspiracy to commit arson, a Class A felony, and one count of witness tampering, a Class B felony, after a tenant in her building told police that Carr was planning to burn down her building at 139 Union Square.
Rick Fells, the owner of the Tasty Tobacco Shop, which was formerly located in the ground floor of the building, said that Maureen Riley, who lived on the third floor, told him of Carr’s alleged plan to commit arson. Riley reportedly told Fells that she was offered $7,000 by Carr to “go away for a week.”
Carr’s building was assessed at $192,000 and was insured for $400,000, according to testimony at her probable cause hearing in February. The building is located next door to a gas station owned by Carr’s ex-husband and is connected to a row of riverfront buildings on the Milford Oval.
Earlier this month, a Hillsborough County grand jury indicted Carr on one count of criminal solicitation to insurance fraud, a Class A felony. According to the indictment, Carr “did solicit Maureen Riley to leave her apartment for a period of time in order for Colleen Carr to commit an arson against the building for the purpose of collecting the insurance proceeds, a portion of which she offered to pay to Maureen Riley for her cooperation.”
In April, a different Hillsborough County Grand Jury indicted Carr on one count of witness tampering for allegedly trying to coerce her boyfriend, Conrad Kelleher, to lie on her behalf.
The solicitation to insurance fraud carries a prison term of 7½ to 15 years in state prison and a $4,000 fine. The witness tampering charge has a penalty of 3½ to seven years and a $4,000 fine.

"Sandy Sting Nets Unlicensed Contractors
Thursday, July 25, 2013
Undercover investigators in New Jersey have nabbed eight alleged unlicensed contractors who gave bids to perform repairs to a Superstorm Sandy-damaged home during a recent sting operation, authorities said.
Photos: Office of the Attorney General
Investigators used a Superstorm Sandy-damaged house in Highlands, NJ, for the recent sting operation.
Four of the home improvement contractors were charged with the fourth degree crime of engaging in home improvement contracting without being registered, the New Jersey Attorney General’s office announced Monday (July 22). The other four were issued civil notices of violations for not having proper permits.
Schemers on Notice
“We’re putting every schemer and fraudster on notice—do not attempt to enrich yourself by victimizing those who already have suffered from Superstorm Sandy and are attempting to rebuild their lives,” Acting Attorney General Hoffman said in a statement.
“Either operate legally or we will hold you accountable.”
Superstorm Sandy crippled the Atlantic Coast on Oct. 29, 2012. The storm damaged or destroyed at least 650,000 houses, according to a recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report .
Sandy is to blame for more than 100 deaths in the U.S. alone.
Undercover Sting
The Statewide Sandy Fraud Working group within the Attorney General’s office executed the investigation using a storm-damaged house in Highlands, NJ.
Investigators identified home improvement contractors via Internet listings, and after checking each for annual registration with the Division of Consumer Affairs, scheduled individual appointments with suspected unregistered contractors. Investigators posed as the homeowners or their relatives.
In addition to allegedly not having proper registration, the contractors offered ""wildly varying assessments"" of the damage and cost estimates for repairs, according to authorities.
The contractors offered “wildly varying assessments” of the damage to the home and cost estimates for rebuilding, authorities said.
Contractors Listed, Potential Penalties
According to the Attorney General’s office, the alleged unregistered contractors who were criminally charged are:
Rev. Victor McGookin III, 53, Seaside Park, NJ;
Michael Kaufmann, 48, Kaufmann Drywall By Design, Philadelphia, PA;
Jason Storey, 46, Work-A-Holics LLC, South Orange, NJ; and
Anthony DiVito, 61, DiVito & Sons LLC, Fanwood, NJ.
A fourth degree criminal offense in New Jersey can carry a penalty of up to 18 months in jail.
In addition, the Division of Consumer Affairs issued Notices of Violation for unregistered practice of home improvement to the following, the Attorney General’s office said.
Darrell Sorger, 43, Toms River, NJ;
Robert Mazzeo, 33, Mazzeo Construction, Keyport, NJ;
Derrick Scott, 54, Lloyd Home Improvement, Matawan, NJ; and

TORONTO -- Toronto police say a husband and wife and their son are facing multiple charges in connection with a $1-million fraud investigation involving life insurance.
Police allege a man bought several life insurance policies totalling about $3.5 million while living in the Toronto area, with the beneficiary of the policies being his wife.
They say that in 2008, the man and his wife travelled to Iran, and that she falsely claimed her husband died of a heart attack while in that country.
Police allege that the man's wife and son initiated the death-claims process with each of the insurance companies and that the companies paid just over $1 million to the woman, which has not been recovered.
The 44-year-old man and his 41-year-old wife were arrested by U.S. marshals in Los Angeles in February in connection with the fraud investigation and their son was arrested in Toronto the same day.
The man and woman were extradited from Los Angeles to Toronto on Thursday.
The husband and wife are each charged with four counts of fraud over $5,000, and the woman is also charged with nine counts of uttering a forged document.
The son is charged with four counts of uttering a forged document and four counts of fraud over $5,000.
The accused are not being identified in this report because police now indicate the son was a youth at the time of the alleged offence.

Troubled drug rehab clinics
In a rehab racket plagued by regulatory holes, paperwork trumps reality, a yearlong investigation by The Center for Investigative Reporting and CNN has found.
Thousands of pages of government records and dozens of interviews with counselors, patients and regulators reveal a widespread scheme to bilk the state's Medicaid system, the nation's largest. The populous Los Angeles region is one of the nation's top hot spots for health care fraud, and former state officials agree it is also ground zero for the rehab racket.
Drug Medi-Cal paid out $94 million in the past two fiscal years to 56 clinics in Southern California that have shown signs of deception or questionable billing practices, representing half of all public funding to the program, CIR and CNN found. Over the past six years, more than half a billion dollars have poured into the program statewide.
The simple stakeout on April 4 raises questions about the adequacy of government oversight of the program to help the poor and addicted, built on an honor system in which honor often is lacking. Oversight is marred by infrequent and cursory inspections and by a failure to act even when red flags appear.
Government officials who try to root out fraud clash with weak regulations, bureaucratic apathy and corruption in their own ranks. Once open, bad clinics rarely are shut down. CIR and CNN identified a dozen clinics caught cheating the system that not only remained in business, but also were rewarded with more public funds.
When told of the April 4 stakeout at Able Family, county regulators said they now have questions about whether the payments were legitimate. The findings merit a closer review but ""look very incriminating,"" said a spokeswoman for Los Angeles County's substance abuse department. Able Family operates a small satellite clinic near downtown, the county noted -- but a security guard there said about 25 people came to that office each day.
The clinic's director, Alexander Ferdman, would not explain the discrepancy.
""I can't explain, because you will cut and paste and edit, and my answers will be to a totally different question,"" Ferdman said in a telephone interview, before hanging up.
CIR and CNN have exposed how clinics use coercion and forgery to defraud a taxpayer-funded program meant to help struggling addicts. The investigation also found that people ineligible to run Medi-Cal clinics did not just slip through the cracks -- they walked through doors regulators left wide open.
Some never should have been allowed in.

Felons are supposed to be blocked from running clinics. That didn't stop Ferdman. He entered the rehab racket two years after leaving a Texas prison, where he served time for orchestrating an organized crime scam. Over the course of a decade, he built his clinic into a $2 million-a-year operation -- all from taxpayer money.
Those on the Medicaid blacklist aren't allowed to bill for rehab funds. But George Ilouno did so repeatedly. Convicted of defrauding the student loan program, Ilouno was barred from collecting a single Medicaid dollar. Still, the state and county paid him more than a million.
Clients who went to GB Medical Services in Long Beach and counselors who worked there described years of graft. Ilouno and his staff bribed clients to show up, they claimed. Counselors fabricated therapy sessions that never took place.
One counselor told state investigators that such fraud was ""rampant from Long Beach to Los Angeles,"" crediting the scammers' ""success to the incompetence of the ... auditors,"" an arrest declaration says.
Federal Medicaid authorities place responsibility for safeguarding taxpayer dollars squarely with California's Department of Health Care Services. And a year after CIR filed its first public records request about Drug Medi-Cal fraud, the department moved earlier this month to temporarily cut funding to 16 rehab clinics.
But according to interviews with former state officials, the department has fielded concerns about rehab clinic fraud for at least five years yet has done almost nothing to combat it.
""Everyone talked the talk, everyone was zero tolerance for fraud and abuse, but nobody would do anything about it,"" said Joy Jarfors, a manager with the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs until 2010. (Photo: CNN)
""Everyone talked the talk, everyone was zero tolerance for fraud and abuse, but no one would do anything about it,"" said Joy Jarfors, who retired in 2010 from a manager position at the Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, which shared the job of clinic oversight until last July.
Responsibility for policing Drug Medi-Cal is split. The state certifies the clinics, but counties handle the money and shoulder the financial risk when mistakes are made. Both county and state analysts audit the clinics annually.
To many inside government and out, it has not been clear who's in charge. In that vacuum, fraud has thrived.
The alcohol and drug department this month merged with the Department of Health Care Services. Diana Dooley, secretary of the governor's Health and Human Services Agency, has overseen both departments since December 2010 but declined to give a sit-down interview about what went wrong.
In a statement announcing the temporary suspensions, Department of Health Care Services Director Toby Douglas said the 16 clinic sites have been referred to the state's Department of Justice. On Wednesday, the health department's chief deputy director, Karen Johnson, said her staff also would be ""fanning out statewide to review every rehab facility.""
Douglas' deputy in charge of audits and investigations, Bruce Lim, said the action was spurred by media inquiries, one of many ways regulators identify problems. Investigators are reviewing issues raised by CIR and CNN, including questions about clinics with felons at the helm, he added.
""That's a top priority for us and a concern,"" Lim said.
Lim, who has been the investigations chief for three years, said he could not identify the clinics or address criticism that his department has long ignored the problem.
""I can't speak for the past,"" he said.
Past fraud conviction
On September 29, 2003, a state alcohol and drug program analyst arrived at a busy Panorama City strip mall to certify the state's newest Drug Medi-Cal clinic, Able Family Support.
Karen Morrison scrutinized the governing body's meeting schedule and reviewed staff résumés. Records from the visit offer no hint that she asked -- or knew -- about the criminal record of the man who greeted her.
Morrison, now a real estate agent, said she does not recall the visit or a provider with a felony history.
But Alexander Ferdman was on parole at the time, having served one year of a seven-year sentence for engaging in organized crime.
Prosecutors in Texas had pegged Ferdman as the ringleader of a scam that robbed auto insurers of millions. An indictment from the Travis County district attorney's office says a team of fixers staged crashes and recruited actual crash victims as pawns to generate fake legal and medical bills.
One witness described Ferdman as the man who paid off operatives from a briefcase full of cash.
Although the state can grant special exceptions for felons to be Medi-Cal providers, it doesn't appear that regulators did so for Ferdman. When he moved to California to open a rehab clinic, nothing in state records indicated that regulators knew about Ferdman's organized crime conviction.
A standard form in 2003 asked about clinic leaders' convictions, but missed the mark, inquiring only about fraud against the government. Ferdman defrauded private insurers. And by late 2011, when Ferdman was asked in a routine disclosure form whether he had been convicted in the last 10 years, he could honestly respond ""no.""
Ferdman told reporters that he accepted a plea agreement in the Texas case because he was facing ""99 years."" He denied any wrongdoing.
""There was no fraud, and there was no record of it in any way,"" Ferdman said. ""It's a very long story.""
Soon after the state cleared his rehab center to open in 2003, Ferdman made some questionable spending decisions.
A state review of the center's 2004 budget revealed that public funds intended to help low-income addicts covered $10,000 in gifts and travel, including $605 spent at a Palm Springs spa resort, a $586 crab feast, $108 for flowers and a Betty Boop souvenir.
In his written response to state auditors, Ferdman defended the spending as ""business purchases"" necessary for ""promoting and outreach"" for the clinic.
Taxpayers also spent $2,000 a month on car expenses for Ferdman and Able Family's co-founder, Leonid Aksert. Ferdman told auditors that the travel stipend was approved by the center's board of directors. State records show that the five-member board included Ferdman, Aksert and their wives.
State auditors asked Los Angeles County to repay the state $68,000 provided to Able Family in 2004. Ultimately, Able Family repaid half of the money the state wanted back.
That wouldn't be the last time Ferdman and Able Family came to the attention of auditors.
Medical license denied, clinic approved
Rebecca Lira was disgusted in 2001 as she watched fraud seep into the rehab system she had helped build two decades before. ""I really wanted to close all of them down, bust all of them, if you will,"" she said.
A deputy director with the state Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, Lira decided to confront the problem by grilling people who applied to launch new clinics.
She said she called applicants and quizzed them about their treatment philosophy. Many hung up and called back in a half-hour with answers. Others just hung up. ""Those are the fly-by-nights -- those are the programs that are, in my opinion ... abusing the system,"" Lira said.
One of the providers she questioned was the program director at GB Medical Services, George Ilouno. Lira concluded that he had ""no clue,"" records show.
Ilouno's problems ran much deeper than limited knowledge of addiction treatment.
State medical regulators had blocked Ilouno from becoming a physician's assistant in 2001, noting that he had been convicted of lying on student loan applications. The medical board concluded that Ilouno's ""multiple acts of wrongdoing demonstrated an ongoing pattern of fraud.""
As a result, the inspector general for the federal Health and Human Services Department put Ilouno on its blacklist, preventing him from billing Medicaid. State Medi-Cal authorities added him to their banned list as well.
Lira's staff vetted GB Medical Services after Ilouno and his wife, Benedicta, co-founded GB Medical in June 2006. Required paperwork filed two months later asked directly: Were any of GB Medical's owners suspended from billing Medicaid or convicted of misdemeanor government fraud?
Benedicta Ilouno indicated she was the sole owner and had a clean record.
Lira's staff, busy asking the couple for staff résumés and a detailed budget, had documents detailing George Ilouno's co-founder role. But there is no record that they followed up.
By late 2007, the Ilounos were in business, according to a letter signed by Lira staffer Allen Scott, a licensing and certification supervisor. Former staff members say George Ilouno ran day-to-day operations.
And, they say, the rehab clinic was scamming from the start.
Counselor Art Hill filed a complaint with state regulators in 2008 charging that staff paid young women $30 to $40 to sign papers saying they were getting drug counseling at GB Medical.
Hill's concerns eventually would be validated after his complaint touched off a criminal probe that led to pleas of no contest by three employees this year. But back in 2008, a state alcohol and drug program investigator deemed his claims unsubstantiated after interviewing staff and clients.
The addict-turned-counselor told CIR that clients spoke openly during his group therapy sessions about being paid to attend. Hill included their comments in his write-ups on the sessions, but he said George Ilouno ordered him to substitute made-up tales of addicts striving to get sober.
One time, Hill said, Ilouno asked him to giftwrap bottles of alcohol, including Hennessy cognac, for the rehab patients. Hill said he won't work in Drug Medi-Cal again after seeing clients exploited.
""As far as staying sober or trying to be clean,"" he said, ""the program is not helping them.""
On behalf of Ilouno, Malibu criminal defense attorney Robert Helfend denied that rehab clients were given alcohol or that session notes were changed. He did not address the claim that clients were paid, but denied that ""clients demanded rising sums of money or financial favors.""
Kanisha Dickerson insists she and four of her teenage children each received at least $5 whenever they attended counseling sessions at GB Medical in 2008. Ilouno would sometimes call her into his office and pay her himself, she said.
Darshaye Miles, 19, says she and others were paid $5 to attend drug counseling sessions at GB Medical Services in Long Beach, California. (Photo: CNN)
Her daughter, Darshaye Miles, 19, said she bought marijuana with the $5 she earned going to rehab. Little counseling or guidance was offered, she said, even to people who needed it.
""I really want the world to hear the story about these alcohol programs because I think that they just scam,"" Miles said. ""They (are) just doing it to get their money.""
The state's probe of GB Medical continued for half a decade, while more than $1 million in Medi-Cal funds went to the operation. In that timeframe, at least 15 state and county officials signed off on certifications, reviews and funding increases.
Once the state Department of Justice launched a formal investigation in 2008, authorities could have followed a state law calling on them to suspend Ilouno's Drug Medi-Cal operation. But they didn't.
Even after a Department of Justice investigator served Los Angeles County with a court order for the clinic's financial records in 2010, the county gave GB Medical a $90,000 annual raise. Its taxpayer funding reached $440,000 last year.
John Viernes Jr., director of Substance Abuse Prevention and Control in Los Angeles County, said he approved the raise after a Department of Justice agent said the investigation was on a back burner and might be closed.
Viernes also said he took into account the fact that his auditors didn't find anything incriminating in their own annual review.
This March, Ilouno was charged with Medi-Cal fraud, grand theft and giving kickbacks. Three counselors were charged with fraud and grand theft; a clinic driver was charged with paying kickbacks. The arrest declaration included an analysis of billing records for the fiscal year ending in 2010, which found $64,400 had been obtained fraudulently.
Ilouno has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Helfend, said in a letter to CIR that counselors acted without GB Medical's knowledge or consent. GB Medical, he added, is prepared to work on a repayment plan, if that becomes necessary.
Of the counselors charged, two pleaded no contest to felony Medi-Cal fraud. The driver pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of paying kickbacks, and the fourth staff member has not yet entered a plea.
After Ilouno's arrest, GB Medical remained open and continued collecting public funds. Its billing slowed dramatically, though, with three clients one day and five the next.
Asked why funding had continued, Los Angeles County spokeswoman Lydia Becerra said her department was unaware that Ilouno had been arrested.
Approached by reporters in the parking lot of his Long Beach clinic in April, Ilouno declined to comment and hopped in his Mercedes, his tires squealing as he sped away. In July, a sign posted on GB Medical's door said the clinic no longer provides Drug Medi-Cal services.
Difficulty policing fraud
Around the time the state alcohol and drug department cleared GB Medical to operate, the only full-time investigator on the department's team was growing disillusioned.
That was in 2008, a turning point in state oversight. Soon, the larger Department of Health Care Services would gain more control through an unusual series of events, but it would wait years -- until earlier this month -- to initiate major changes.
Drug and alcohol investigator Lorna Flores recalls turning down bribes from clinics even as she tried to clean up the program.
""I speculated that we were seeing the tip of an iceberg,"" said Flores, who today works in the private rehab sector with her former boss, Rebecca Lira. ""At that time, I would have said 50 percent of the programs out there are potentially fraudulent in L.A. County.""
Flores left state service soon after Lira, in 2008, disheartened that she could not seem to solve the problem.
Then, things took a strange turn.
Gary Goethe assumed control of the small Drug Medi-Cal investigations unit. In 2009, the FBI arrested him on charges of extorting cash from a clinic owner. Goethe pleaded guilty but characterizes his actions as trying to root out fraud through an overzealous sting.
""I was really trying to elicit wrongdoing from providers,"" Goethe said in an interview. ""I was left out to dry by myself, with no support from the department on my fraud efforts.""
Karen Johnson, the chief deputy director of the Department of Health Care Services, said Goethe's arrest undermined investigative efforts.
After Goethe's arrest, a state drug and alcohol official ordered staff to stop passing cases of suspected fraud directly to criminal investigators. Instead, cases would be referred to health services, which would decide whether to refer them to law enforcement.
Jarfors, then the Drug Medi-Cal supervisor, said the edict pushed her staff too far from the action of prosecuting fraud.
Little had come out of monthly anti-fraud meetings led by investigation leaders in the Department of Health Care Services, Jarfors claimed. ""We practically stood on tables just screaming, we brought it up at every opportunity that we could, and nothing would be done,"" she said.
Daniel Steinhart, Jarfors' boss, agreed that the anti-fraud meetings were all talk and no action. And he said he knows his order to shift decision-making to the Department of Health Care Services disappointed his staff. They believed the larger department viewed rehab clinic cases as minor compared with other health scams.
""The general belief was (the rehab cases) were small potatoes -- they weren't interested,"" Steinhart said.
Funding hard to cut off
The head of L.A. County's substance abuse department for five years is at once part of the problem and part of the solution.
John Viernes has worked with other county substance abuse leaders to point out flaws in the Drug Medi-Cal counseling program and has advocated for other styles of treatment proven to turn around lives.
But he's also signed off on raises for providers repeatedly accused of cheating or caught in deceptive billing practices.
Viernes says he has little choice.
The state allows almost anyone to open a clinic, he said. And once it's running, owners are entitled to public funding for as many patients as they sign up under a 1994 court ruling, Sobky v. Smoley, which establishes Medi-Cal patients' right to drug treatment. The county, according to Viernes, is obligated to contract with state-certified clinics and sign off on their funding.
""This program is just not well run,"" Viernes said of state oversight.
Viernes' deputy Michael Kerr supervises a staff of seven ""contract monitors"" who inspect 120 counseling clinics annually, plus 20 more methadone clinics. Each clinic may have one or more sites; some have more than a dozen.
Around the state, Drug Medi-Cal clinics submit bills and regularly receive payment from the counties within weeks. State and county auditors discover taxpayer money has been squandered only if they later review the clinics' client charts.
The county's enforcement vigor has waned considerably in recent years. Viernes signed off on a blitz of nine contract terminations in 2009, shutting down one Wilshire Boulevard clinic that paid two clients $20 each to sign admission paperwork used to generate $11,000 in bills for phantom care.
His team cut off another pair of clinics -- in Los Angeles and Compton -- caught billing for the same clients' care at the same time, eight miles apart.
Even as complaints and evidence of cheating piled up, the county pulled back -- and closed no clinics this year. Viernes said officials have shifted toward helping clinics improve when they fail to meet standards.
The state alcohol and drug department has suspended or terminated certification for at least three clinics since 2009, under a state law that calls for such action during a fraud probe. The Department of Health Care Services declined to identify any cases in which it had cut off a clinic until its crackdown in July.
Funding still flows
Seven years after Alexander Ferdman had his Palm Springs spending spree, auditors in L.A. County began to question whether some of the counseling sessions at his clinic actually took place.
Able Family billed for a group therapy session held on a Sunday when the counseling center was closed, according to a July 2011 county billing review. The 10 a.m. on-site review also turned up notes recounting results of a group therapy session that had not yet been held.
Despite having funds at Able Family Support docked by regulators twice, for a Palm Springs spending spree and fraudulent billing, Alexander Ferdman continued to draw increasing amounts of taxpayer money -- up to $2 million this year. (Photo: CNN)
County auditors issued a report warning Ferdman that the county considers such findings evidence of ""fraudulent practices"" and that the clinic could lose its contract. The county ultimately docked him $7,000.
And then the funding boosts came. Viernes approved an increase in Able Family's funding from $1.6 million in 2011 to nearly $2 million in 2013. Kerr, the county's Drug Medi-Cal supervisor, said such funding increases are approved routinely if clinics fix problems cited in audits.
When reporters laid out the results of their April 2013 stakeout to county regulators, officials pledged to follow up. County auditors went out to dig through paperwork at the clinic last week, only to find Able Family closed.
The clinic's medical director, Dr. Howard Oliver, told CNN that Able Family had been suspended by the state -- a month after reporters confronted California's top health official about Ferdman's record and after the county was notified about the stakeout results.
The doctor praised Ferdman, saying he was helping people and ""I've never seen him do anything wrong.""
Back in Texas, defense attorney Barrett Hansen was bemused to learn of Ferdman's 10-year career in government contracting. Hansen worked as a prosecutor on Ferdman's insurance fraud case.
""If the state of California is willing to throw money at him,"" she said, ""he's willing to catch it.""

"Man Told Police He Wasn't Getting His Share Of Medicaid Scam, Officials Say
Brian Borry (Connecticut Division of Criminal Justice / July 26, 2013)
By STEPHEN BUSEMEYER, sbusemeyer@courant.com The Hartford Courant
5:10 p.m. EDT, July 26, 2013
PLAINVILLE — A 43-year-old man was arrested Friday after he allegedly went to police to complain that a disabled woman who concocted a Medicaid fraud scheme wasn't giving him his fair share of the proceeds.
Brian Borry, of Dwight Street in Plainville , told police he worked as a personal care assistant to the woman, according to a release from the state Division of Criminal Justice.
He and the woman submitted 27 fraudulent billings to the state, according to the release. They claimed that Borry worked more than twice as much as he actually worked, and he was paid $15,065 for about $6,600 worth of work, the release states.
The woman allegedly deposited the checks and paid Borry. But Borry went to Plainville police because he wasn't getting as much money as he thought he should, the release states.

The Personal Care Assistance program, which is funded by Medicaid, provides money so disabled adults can hire assistants to care for them at their homes.
Borry was arrested by inspectors from the Medicaid fraud control unit of the Office of the Chief State's Attorney. He faces charges including first-degree larceny by defrauding a public community, conspiracy to commit first-degree larceny and insurance fraud.
He could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison if he is convicted.
More arrests are expected, the release states.

Washington State Charges Woman With Work Comp Fraud; Awards Grant
By ReduceYourWorkersComp 07/26/2013 08:30:00
Font size:
Washington State’s Labor & Industries (L&I) Department recently reported charges levied against a woman for alleged workers compensation fraud, along with the awarding of a grant to return injured construction workers to their jobs sooner.
 
Woman Faces Five Counts of Theft For Fraudulent Work Comp Benefits
 
In the first incident, the 39-year-old Tacoma woman faces charges on five counts of theft for fraudulently collecting more than $50,000 in workers comp benefits from the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (L&I).
 
According to the Washington State Attorney General’s Office, Deana S. Cook filed workers comp claims for injuries that occurred in 2007 and 2009. The claims were allowed and Cook was able to receive the benefits based on her contention that she was unable to work due to the injuries.
 
Meantime, a routine check of social security numbers between L&I and the Washington State Employment Security Department allegedly showed that Cook worked for a pair of different employers during the time her work comp benefits were paid.
 
Cook faces three counts of first degree theft and a pair of counts of second degree theft. She has entered not guilty pleas to all five charges.
 
Grant Awarded For Construction Return to Work
 
In other news, (L&I) recently awarded the SMART Association and the Master Builders Association of King and Snohomish Counties an $85,000 grant to partner in creating a program to place injured construction workers back on the job sooner rather than later.
 
The Return-to-Work grant, which is part of the Safety & Health Investment Projects (SHIP) Program, will fund the creation of an Internet-based Return-to-Work Toolbox — a database of job tasks and documentation that can be shared with employers across the state.
 
Grant Project Solves Problem Many Companies Face
 
This grant project will solve a problem faced by many companies that find they have to create or recreate documentation for return-to-work job tasks for injured workers because there is no simple method for companies to share this information.
 
The SMART Association is a non-profit business association providing companies with resources necessary to manage and control risk in Washington state. The Master Builders Association serves Seattle, King County and Snohomish County as the nation’s largest local homebuilders association.

LAFAYETTE, Louisiana — A Lafayette man has pleaded guilty to staging vehicle accidents in order to defraud insurance companies.
U.S. Attorney Stephanie A. Finley says 44-year-old Oliver Lockett entered the plea Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Richard T. Haik.
Lockett admitted to causing multiple vehicle accidents from 2003 through March 10, 2010. He also admitted to conspiring with others who knew ahead of time there would be a crash. Some of the co-conspirators, Finley said in a news release Thursday, traveled in separate cars behind Lockett and would pose as independent witnesses. As a result, Lockett made numerous claims for property damage and personal injury.
Lockett faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
A sentencing date has not been set.

North Wales man given suspended prison term over car insurance scam
He had three cars but only paid insurance on one, until spotted by eagle-eyed police officer
North Wales Police Officer
AN unemployed man David Hett hit on a novel idea to pay less car insurance.
He had three cars but only paid insurance on one.
Mold Crown Court heard that Hett registered the two other cars in other people’s names so that he could drive all three on one policy.
But an eagle-eyed police officer who stopped him before became suspicious.
Hett, 48, of Bro Alun in Mold, admitted two counts of perverting  the course of justice by registering vehicles under false names and not insuring them. He also admitted two counts of driving without insurance.
Judge Niclas Parry gave him a five month prison sentence suspended for a year, banned him from driving for six months and ordered him to carry out 150 hours unpaid work and pay £200 costs.

A former Marshalltown insurance agent was indicted on federal mail fraud charges last week after allegedly defrauding customers for nearly a decade.
William Arthur Thiede, 65, is charged with five counts of mail fraud after allegedly bilking customers for $167,636.80 in payments on phony insurance policies from January 2002 until he left American Family Insurance in September 2010.
Thiede is a former president of the local chamber of commerce.

Shawna Jacobs, formerly of Marshall County, was a client of Thiede's for nine years and shortly after Thiede resigned she learned that premiums she'd been paying on personal and business insurance were allegedly going into Thiede's pocket.
""They weren't legitimate,"" Jacobs said. ""I was extremely shocked.""
Jacobs no longer lives in the area and would not say if she plans to sue Thiede.
""I hope that other people call and inquire about their accounts,"" Jacobs said.
The only named victim in the indictments is the Central Iowa Coonhunters Association based in Toledo. Attempts to call and email the president of that organization Monday were unsuccessful. The other alleged victims were referred to only by initials.
Attempts to reach Thiede were unsuccessful.

"Italian police break up mobsters' insurance fraud

The Associated Press
ROME — Police in southern Italy on Friday broke up a multi-million euro insurance fraud racket run by a crime syndicate that depended on the collusion of doctors, lawyers and auto repair shop owners.
Rodolfo Ruperti, a police official based in Catanzaro, a stronghold of the Calabria-based 'ndrangheta syndicate, said the bosses of the Giampa' clan used the proceeds from the reporting of fake accidents — millions of euros each year — to pay the ""salaries"" of rank-and-file mobsters.
A total of 65 warrants were issued, but many of those sought were already in prison for other crimes.
In a separate crackdown in the Rome seaside suburb of Ostia, police aided by search dogs and helicopter surveillance fanned out to arrest 51 people suspected of involvement in a money laundering scam that used the town's bathing establishments and other local businesses, prosecutors and police told a news conference.
The investigation, aided by information supplied by turncoats from the Sicilian Mafia, probed a series of killings, arson fires and bombings of businesses to intimidate owners into letting mobsters' infiltrate or take over the enterprises.
In another development, Italy's war on organized crime has a new anti-Mafia czar, Franco Roberti, a veteran prosecutor who has battled the Camorra crime syndicate in the Campania region. He fills the vacancy created a few months earlier when Pietro Grasso, now Senate president, quit to enter politics.
Italy's anti-mafia initiatives have relied heavily on turncoats, but some of the top imprisoned bosses have resisted.
Among those is Bernardo Provenzano, the reputed ""boss of bosses"" who was captured in a farmhouse near Corleone, Sicily, in 2006, after decades on the run.  Imprisoned for life for the murders of more than a dozen mobsters, Provenzano has been held in strict conditions prescribed by law for convicted organized crime bosses, including infrequent visits by family members.
On Friday, prosecutors, citing health reasons, gave their backing to less stringent prison conditions for Provenzano, Italian news reports said. Last year, he had brain surgery after injuring his head in a fall at a top-security prison, and his health has reportedly been deteriorating. The justice ministry must still sign off on any easing of prison conditions for Provenzano.

BALTIMORE — A pharmacy owner and two workers have been indicted on charged of health care fraud and identity theft in an alleged plot to submit false claims to Medicaid and Medicare.
Forty-five-year-old Reddy Vijay Annappareddy of Fallston, 30-year-old Vipinkumar Patel of Edgewood and 27-year-old Jigar Patel of Columbia were indicted July 23. The Patels are not related.
Prosecutors say the three identified customers at two Bel Air pharmacies who had prescription refills available. Authorities say the three would file claims for reimbursement, and restock medications that were not delivered or picked up.
Prosecutors say the alleged scheme defrauded $2.6 million from Medicaid and Medicare.

Earlier this month, the Obama Administration—in a 600-plus page regulation—announced that for 2014, Obamacare insurance subsidies will essentially operate on the “ honor system .” This will create incentives for fraud, as some applicants may report an income that is actually lower than their true income in order to qualify for the taxpayer-funded subsidy.
In most cases, the IRS will not attempt to verify an individual’s income when he or she is applying for subsidies. Supporters of the law claim that the changes will not encourage fraud, because “applicants who receive [subsidies] for which they are ineligible will have to pay them back when they file their taxes.” Unfortunately, that claim isn’t entirely accurate. Some individuals will only face a maximum $2,500 in repayment, while receiving far more in benefits.
Before explaining the loophole, some background about the subsidies. Obamacare provides exchange insurance subsidies for Americans who do not have access to “affordable” employer-sponsored health coverage. The subsidies are provided on a sliding scale based on income. Americans with incomes between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL)—between about $31,800 and $94,200 for a family of four—qualify for premium subsidies, and applicants with incomes under 250 percent of the FPL—about $59,000 for a family of four—will also receive additional subsidies to reduce or cover cost-sharing requirements (e.g., deductibles and co-payments).
Subsidies will be based on an applicant’s self-reported income at the time of application, meaning that subsidies for 2014 will be calculated based on income reported by applicants in fall 2013. However, the income reported on applications in fall 2013 could vary significantly from income reported on 2014 tax returns, filed with the IRS in spring 2015—either because of a change in life circumstances (e.g., divorce, birth, death, change in job, etc.), or because an individual misrepresented income on his application.
If an individual receives subsidies in error, he will have to pay the subsidies back—but there are limits on the amount individuals will have to repay. Those who should never have received an income-based subsidy—because their income exceeds 400 percent FPL—will have to repay the full amount of the subsidy they received. However, those with incomes under 400 percent FPL—who qualify for some level of subsidy, just not as much as they actually received—will only have to pay back up to $2,500 of the difference between the subsidies they actually received and the subsidies they should have received.
It’s this loophole that will encourage fraud—because individuals can gain more in benefits than they will have to repay, by understating their income. Take an example of an honest family of four—two adults, both aged 40, and two children—with income of $90,000 (just under 400 percent FPL). According to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s subsidy calculator , this family would receive a subsidy of $2,997 to help them pay for insurance. That insurance would carry with it maximum out-of-pocket expenses of $12,700, meaning that the family’s health care costs could not exceed $12,700 for the year.
Compare that scenario to what happens if the same family were to be dishonest and report income of only $35,000—or just above 138 percent FPL—on their application. According to the Kaiser calculator , the family would receive a subsidy of $10,175 to pay for insurance. That’s $7,178 in taxpayer-funded insurance subsidies over the $2,997 they should have received if they were honest.
In addition, the family would also qualify for reduced cost-sharing limits within their insurance plan—their out-of-pocket expenses could total no more than $4,500 per year, because additional federal subsidies would reduce their cost-sharing limits. That’s an additional $8,200 in cost-sharing assistance from federal taxpayers ($12,700 minus $4,500), depending on their annual medical expenses. Yet under current law, the family would only have to repay a maximum of $2,500 of these improperly obtained premium and cost-sharing subsidies—meaning they would benefit by thousands of dollars, and potentially more than $10,000, by mis-stating their income on their exchange application.
To sum up: Individuals with incomes below 400 percent FPL will not have to pay back the entire amount of any subsidies received improperly. In many of these cases, individuals will receive more in benefits than they will have to repay the federal government. Therefore, as long as they will qualify for some subsidy, dishonest individuals have incentive to fudge their income so they receive the maximum subsidy—in order to maximize the benefits they receive.
Supporters of the law claim this scenario will not happen, due to the penalties associated with misrepresenting information on application forms and tax documents. But with government auditors noting the exchanges have missed critical deadlines, and Obamacare anti-fraud investigations being cancelled , will the federal government really have the resources necessary to enforce the law, much less ensure taxpayer funds are not being abused?
These warped incentives, combined with massive bureaucracy where the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing, are simply more reasons why Congress should refuse to spend a single dime funding Obamacare .

"Former Murphys man admits to causing son’s death

Former Murphys man admits to causing son’s death Enterprise report Calaveras Enterprise
A former Murphys man confessed through tears to having knocked a pickup truck off a jack and causing his son’s death during last week. But he adamantly claims it was an accident.
Karl Karlsen, 53, lived in Murphys in the 1980s and early 1990s. Now, he awaits a trial in New York on charges of insurance fraud and murder filed in November 2012.
The death of Karlsen’s son, Levi Karlsen, in November 2008, was originally ruled an accident. But when Seneca County authorities discovered Levi Karlsen had taken out a $700,000 life insurance policy 17 days before his death – and named his father as the sole beneficiary – the case was re-opened in March 2012.
After an eight-month investigation, Seneca County Sheriff’s Deputies said Karlsen allegedly caused the death of his 23-year-old son four years prior.
While Karlsen awaits the upcoming murder trial – scheduled to begin in October – his on-tape confession and other evidence will be heard to determine if the evidence can be used during the trial.
The police interrogation lasted almost 10 hours and is being reviewed as part of a request by Karlsen’s attorney, who is seeking to have it excluded from the trial. The last hour-and-a-half of video will play in the courtroom Aug. 2.
The New York case propelled Calaveras County District Attorney’s Office to re-examine an investigation involving Karlsen’s first wife, Christina Karlsen, who died in Murphys house fire in January 1991. This death, like that of Karlsen’s son, was ruled an accident.
Investigator’s reports described a fast-moving fire started with a kerosene spill in the hallway outside the bathroom door. It was fanned both by fumes and rags used in an attempted cleanup, leaving 30-year-old Christina trapped just feet away behind a heavy plywood sheet barring her escape or rescue through the bathroom window.
The Jan. 9, 1991, edition of the Enterprise details a timeline laid out by California Department of Forestry officials. It puts Karlsen working in the garage at the start of the fire. Smoke was already pouring out of the attic by the time he pulled Levi from a broken bedroom window before running to save daughters Erin and Kati only moments before the home was engulfed in flames. Karlsen told responders he was alerted to the fire by Christina’s screams from the bathroom, but could not reach her in time.
A week after the fire, Karlsen collected on a $200,000 insurance policy and moved the couple’s three children to Varick, N.Y.
In January, Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office Deputies began questioning those mentioned in the 1991 fire report. The case was sent to Calaveras County District Attorney Barbara Yook. As of yet, no charges have been filed against Karlsen in this case.
